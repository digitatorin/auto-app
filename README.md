# Introduction

An open-source autorickshaw services application on the Android platform.

## Key Ideas

* Users can ask for auto-rickshaws much like Uber, Ola etc.
* During off peak hours, or places without many autos, users can offer to pay a 'bonus' which will be broadcast to auto drivers in the vicinity or in larger circles around the user.
* The entire app and service will be open source.
* Anyone can run their own service for their own cities.
* We will document the process of setting up this service for auto-rickshaw unions in Kerala as we proceed.

## Challenges

* Ola's pricing strategy of paying the driver Rs. 10-20 along with a similar fee that the driver collects from the user will be hard to match.
* How is Ola doing this?
* Is Ola selling data collected by this platform?
* Being open source, people will know what information our app collects.
* Will that be enough of a differentiator in the market place?
