# Introduction

We intend to build an open source auto-rickshaw service and mobile phone application. This particular repository is intended to do research on the overall idea of the service, how it will function and how it will be financially sustainable.

# History 

The idea came a few years ago when I was looking at co-operatives and other structures as more fair or equitable modes of organization. I was also interested in developing something for auto-rickshaw drivers since I frequently used them. At that point as Androids and smartphones were not as ubiquitous I began developing the application on J2ME.

My goal was simple. Instead of trying to build a company that would own the proprietary software, systems and everything else and where the auto-rickshaw drivers would be working for the company one way or another. I would build an open-source application and service which could be run by any union or co-operative. I was trying to figure out ways in which the service could be run which would be able to sustain itself as well as to sustain the services of one or more developers who could continue to maintain and support the open-source application and service.

Currently I am seeing some discussions around [platform co-operatives](http://platformcoop.net/) which seems to fit the broader goals of this project.

## Key Ideas

* Users can ask for auto-rickshaws much like Uber, Ola etc.
* During off peak hours, or places without many autos, users can offer to pay a 'bonus' which will be broadcast to auto drivers in the vicinity or in larger circles around the user.
* The entire app and service will be open source.
* Anyone can run their own service for their own cities.
* We will document the process of setting up this service for auto-rickshaw unions in Kerala and Karnataka as we proceed.

## Challenges/Questions

* How will this service generate revenue?
* Ola's pricing strategy of paying the driver Rs. 10-20 along with a similar fee that the driver collects from the user will be hard to match.
* Ola also buys the auto-rickshaw driver the smartphones with their app pre-installed.
* How is Ola doing this?
* Is Ola selling data collected by this platform?
* Being open source, people will know what information our app collects if anything.
* Will being open-source be enough of a differentiator in the market place?
