# Minimum Viable Product.
The mvp should be so simple as it should be. There are so many alternatives.
In my idea, The minimum viable product is as follows

## Server
Backend server should be capable of recieving a request with current location from end user. Response of the request is list of auto rickshaws around current location. 

Another facility needed is  registering auto rickshaw cooperative unions and auto rickshaw drivers.
Drivers will register under a cooperative union and cooperative union will verify the driver.
Driver rating is another capability needed for MVP.

In some areas, where fare meters is not practical, like villages, it is not possible. 
There, a commonly agreed fare by the drivers cooperative society is getting paid.
We can use that and give available to the users. 

People who dont have a smart phone could be able to register in the server, manually by the cooperative society with the basic details.

## Mobile End User Client
The Android mobile client should be capable of
* requesting nearby rickshaws with user's current location 
* process its response and display list of auto rickshaws available.
* Detailed view of a single auto rickshaw will have the following
    * Auto Rickshaw Photo
    * Driver Name
    * Driver phone number for calling.
    * facilities availiable such as music, fare meter etc.
    * average rating available for the driver.

## Mobile Auto Rickshaw driver Client.
The driver mobile client, will be able to update their basic details. The driver client should send their location details to the server. 

* Update driver details like
    * Name.
    * Auto name.
    * Facilities.
    * Phone number.
    * Photo.
* Control The frequency of polling location details.
