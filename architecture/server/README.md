# Introduction

This section details the architecture of the server.

# Requirements

Server will largely serve as an API platform providing:

* User authentication.
* Queing available auto-rickshaws by location.
* Assigning the closest auto to the user.
* Allowing different algorithms for assigning rides to drivers. Such as assigning rides that take drivers closer to their home at the end of their shift.
* Recording rides and perhaps optionally GPS tracks if the driver and user agree.
* User/driver statistics
* User/driver rating service
