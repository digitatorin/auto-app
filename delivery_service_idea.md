#Food delivery service along with fare sharing

It will be more efficiant use of the service if we are putting more services to auto app.
Imagine if a food delivery alone costs 100INR, and if there are two or three people are going on the way to where the food is to be delivered. then the cost being shared, then It will be slashed into half, one by third or even less of the total. this will be in the drivers point of view, it will be an extra income. Which will help to pay for the service, if we are billing them for the service, we are providing. 
in the passengers point of view, literally, 3 passengers can travel in an auto. If there is a food packet on the board, then the total charges can be reduced to `one by forth > payment amount per head > one by third`.
this will be beneficial for both passenger, auto driver and also the service provider.

**Expansion needed.
