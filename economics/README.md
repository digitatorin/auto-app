# Introduction

This section covers all the economics and organizational aspects of the auto app and service.

# Economic model

The app and service will require funds to keep the project alive. We have identified the following potential sources of funds:

* Charging the user
* Charging the auto driver
* Crowd funding
* Other research funds/grants

## Challenges

Ola, Uber and other services currently charge users Rs. 10 for using the service which is paid to the driver. On top of this money the driver earns another Rs. 20,30 per ride which they get from Ola or Uber directly. This kind of incentive will be hard to beat for an open source enterprise without a large deal of funding. Will the fact that we are open source and co-operatively operated be enough of a differentiator for people to buy-in to the platform and use this? What are the other incentives we can offer to encourage adoption of this platform?

# Research

Some basic research:

* How many autorickshaws are operating in India? How many autos per capita?
* How many taxis are operating in India?
* How do autorickshaw drivers operate? How many hours do they work, how much do they earn? Do they have smart phones, do they have GPS?
* What can we find out about end-users? How aware are they of open source? Are they concerned about the sale of their personal data to corporations and others? Do they have any concerns about privacy?

## Questionnaires

We have the following questionnaires for:

* [drivers](questionnaire_for_drivers.md)
* [customers](questionnaire_for_customers.md)

# Ideas

Further ideas for expanding the service:

* [Ride sharing](ride_share_idea.md) - Customers can opt for ride sharing and perhaps pay a lower fee? The auto driver can also get a little more income by ride sharing. Since by filling up the auto they will get more money per trip that they make.
* [Delivery Service](delivery_service_idea.md) - The autos can also double up as delivery service.


# Key differentiators

The service will offer the following services which will be different from other services currently being offered.

* Open source app and server - Providing a greater degree of transparency about what kinds of data gets collected by the system.
* Co-operatively owned and operated - Users will be supporting local auto drivers and business rather than large anonymous corporations with questionable ethics.
* The service can allow auto drivers to select a home base, and towards the end of their shift assign rides which are getting them closer towards their home. (Should ask if this will be enough of a differentiator for auto drivers in the questionnaire? They will probably say yes in large cities like Bangalore, maybe not so much in smaller towns)
* The service can allow for bidding or bonus system. Passengers who are finding it hard to find an auto can broadcast a voluntary 'bonus' that they will pay for reaching their destination. Auto drivers can accept or reject these offers.
