# Brief

Currently transport apps on the smartphone allow single users to travel to their destination.

Can transport apps be used to manage and co-ordinate ride shares? Can taxis or autos traveling in one direction be directed to pickup people en-route to their destination and drop them off on the way. Will this be viable and will enough people be interested in something like this?

Or will the kinds of people who own smartphones not really be looking for ride shares and instead of saving some money and the environment, opt for getting to their destination quicker instead?
