# Synopsis

## Summary

The goal of the start-up is to see if it will be possible to build a
business model around open-source applications. There are a number 
of transport service applications such as *Ola*, *Uber* and others which provide
customers with options to ride cars, autos and also link them to other
services. But all these applications are closed source and customers are
never sure how their data is being traded or sold.

We intend to see if we can provide a viable open-source alternative to
these applications and services and develop them along with auto-driver
co-operatives and unions. We would like to build a viable business model
on open source, such that if it succeeds then it can continue to fund
the ongoing development and enhancement of the product and service.

## Objectives
