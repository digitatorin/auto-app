# Synopsis

## Summary

The goal of the start-up is to see if it will be possible to build a
business model around open-source applications. There are a number 
of transport service applications such as *Ola*, *Uber* and others which provide
customers with options to ride cars, autos and also link them to other
services. But all these applications are closed source and customers are
never sure how their data is being traded or sold.

We intend to see if we can provide a viable open-source alternative to
these applications and services and develop them along with auto-driver
co-operatives and unions. We would like to build a viable business model
on open source, such that if it succeeds then it can continue to fund
the ongoing development and enhancement of the product and service.

## Objectives

1. Provide auto-rickshaw drivers a platform to increase their revenue.
2. Provide customers easily find and use auto rickshaw rides.
3. Provide save rides in both rural and urban areas.
4. Increase bargain-ability of customer.
5. Experiment on open source business model.

## Plan

### Expected duration to complete Initial prototype

Although it is difficult to estimate the time on something like this. We would like to start testing the service with auto drivers and customers in a years time.

### Income model

We will be exploring multiple sources of income including:

* charging the user of the application/service
* charging the auto-driver
* raising funds through other sources - crowd sourcing, donations etc.

### Expenses Expected

Broadly the main costs of running this will be:

* Development
* Maintenance - ongoing server hosting cost, systems administration costs
* Administration, Billing and Operations of the organization

Expenses are divided into the following. 
1. Server and server maintenance expenses.
2. Certificates and certification expenses. (what is this?)
3. Domain and other security related expenses.
4. Labor expenses.
    1. For developing the application.
    2. For developing the infrastructure.
    3. For maintaining the infrastructure.
    4. For securing the infrastructure.


## Future expansion plans

1. Ride sharing of auto services.
2. Discounted rides.
